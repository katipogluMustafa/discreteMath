# Relational Thinking

As most mathematical problems contain different objects that are related to each other,
this chapter considers Relational Thinking. 

Finding the relationships among objects often is the first step in solving a mathematical problem. 

The mathematical structures of sets, relations, functions, and graphs describe these relationships, and thus this chapter focuses on exploring ways to use these structures to model mathematical relationships. 

Graph theory is introduced early and used throughout the chapter.
