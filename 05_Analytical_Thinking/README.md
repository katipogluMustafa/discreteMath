# Analytical Thinking

Many applications of discrete mathematics use algorithms, and thus it is essential to be able to understand and analyze them. 

This chapter builds on the four foundations of thinking covered in the first four chapters, applying quantitative and relational thinking to the study of algorithm complexity, and then applying logical and recursive thinking to the study of program correctness. 

Finally, students will study mathematical ways to determine the accuracy and efficiency of algorithms.
