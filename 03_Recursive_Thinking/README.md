# Recursive Thinking

Many objects in nature have recursive structures:

* A branch of a tree looks like a smaller tree; 

* An ocean swell has the same shape as the ripples formed by its splashes; 

* An onion holds a smaller onion under its outer layer. 

Finding similar traits in mathematical objects unleashes a powerful tool. 

This chapter begins by studying simple recurrence relations and then considers other recursive structures in a variety of contexts.

Students also will cover recursive definitions, including how to write their own, and will extend the technique of induction to prove facts about recursively defined objects.
