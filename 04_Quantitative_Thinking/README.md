# Quantitative Thinking

This chapter engages the reader in **Quantitative Thinking**, as many problems in
mathematics, computer science, and other disciplines involve counting the elements of a set of objects. 

The chapter examines the different tools used to count certain types of sets and teaches
students to think about problems from a quantitative point of view. 

After exploring the different enumeration techniques, students will consider applications, including a first look at how to count operations in an algorithm.
 
 This chapter also will practice the art of estimation, a valuable skill when precise enumeration is difficult.
